/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS (and SCSS, if configured) file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, or any plugin's
 * vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS
 * files in this directory.
 *
 * Important NOTE:
 * Sprockets provides some directives that are placed inside of comments called:
 *    - require_tree
 *    - require_self
 * DO NOT USE THEM IN YOUR SASS/SCSS FILES. 
 * They are very primitive and do not work well with Sass files. 
 * Instead, use Sass's > native @import directive
 * which sassc-rails has customized to integrate with the conventions of your Rails projects.

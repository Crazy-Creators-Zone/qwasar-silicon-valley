    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p><b>My Users App</b> is a Web-Application that was implemented using the very famous Architecture Pattern > <b>MVC | Model View Controller</b>.</p>
    <p><b>MVC</b> is the most popular Architecture for building complex Web-Servers. It is used by many Frameworks, and implemented into nearly every modern Web-Application.</p>
    <p><b>MVC</b> divides application into 3-Components > Each with a specific responsibility.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Model</b></li>
        <p>The Model handles data validation, logic, and persistence. It interacts directly with the database to handle the data. The Controller will get all of its data information by asking the Model about the data.</p>
        <li><b>View</b></li>
        <p>The View handles presenting the information. It will usually render dynamic HTML pages based on the data the model fetches. The Controller is responsible for passing that data between the Model and View, so that the Model and View never have to interact with each other.</p>
        <li><b>Controller</b></li>
        <p>The Controller handles user requests and delegates information between the Model and the View. It only deals with requests, and never handles data or presentation.</p>
    </ul>
